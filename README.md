# Overview 

In this project, I wrote a code about bike sharing. I used pyhton for this.

# Bike Share Data 

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

# Have to Use Script 

Pyhton 3.6
Visual Studio Code
Anaconda
Numpy
Git 2.3


# The Datasets 
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

**Statistics Computed**
I learned about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, i wrote code to provide the following information:

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

total travel time
average travel time
counts of each user type

counts of each gender
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth
